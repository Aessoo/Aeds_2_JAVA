# Sorting Methods Project

This project implements various sorting algorithms in Java, alongside a main class for managing player data.

## Folder Structure
- `JogadorMain.java`: The main class for handling player data.
- `Jogador1.1/`: Sequential Search implementation.
- `Jogador1.2/`: Selection Sort implementation.
- `Jogador1.3/`: Insertion Sort implementation.
- `Jogador1.4/`: Heap Sort implementation.
- `Jogador1.5/`: Counting Sort implementation.
- `Jogador1.6/`: Merge Sort implementation.
- `Jogador1.7/`: Partial Insertion Sort implementation.

## JogadorMain
The core class of the project, designed to handle player data read from a file. It serves as the backbone of the application, ensuring efficient data storage, access, and manipulation.

## Sorting Algorithms
### Sequential Search (Folder `Jogador1.1/`)
A straightforward search algorithm implemented for finding elements in a dataset.

### Selection Sort (Folder `Jogador1.2/`)
A simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

### Insertion Sort (Folder `Jogador1.3/`)
A comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

### Heap Sort (Folder `Jogador1.4/`)
An efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

### Counting Sort (Folder `Jogador1.5/`)
A non-comparison sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value.

### Merge Sort (Folder `Jogador1.6/`)
An efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer strategy.

### Partial Insertion Sort (Folder `Jogador1.7/`)
An adaptation of the insertion sort algorithm that partially sorts the data for quicker results in specific scenarios.
