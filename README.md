# PUC Minas AEDS Projects in Java

Welcome to my collection of projects developed for the Data Structures and Algorithms (AEDS) course at PUC Minas. All projects in this repository are implemented in the Java programming language.

## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various projects and assignments completed during my AEDS course at PUC Minas. Each project focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm, providing practical experience in Java programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these projects, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code with Java support

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aessoo/Aeds_2_JAVA.git
2. Navigate to the specific project directory:
   ```sh
   cd aeds-projects-java/project-directory
3. Compile and run the Java file through your IDE or using the command line.

## Projects Index

1. **Sorting Methods**: This project is an implementation of various sorting algorithms in Java. It involves classes and methods that showcase different sorting techniques and their applications.

2. **Project 2 (In Production)**: This project is currently under development. More details will be provided upon completion.
